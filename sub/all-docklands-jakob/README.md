# Docklands Gate

The docklands gate connects modules across streets to keep atractiveness bonus.

## Docklands Module

The building is available in the docklands module construction.

Note: the menu has no scroll option. It may not show if you already have too many modules.

The module is also available in the NW when you play with [New World Docklands](https://www.nexusmods.com/anno1800/mods/215).
New World Docklands must be loaded first, so best not change the folder names of mods.
