Add diagonal residences and ornaments to break up the standard grid.

## Recommended Mods

- `Electric Poles` changes poles and wires into more elegant versions that work well with diagonals.

## Buildings

Use Shift+V to cycle through variations before you place it.
You need to relocate if you want to change an existing building.

Buildings are fully functional, but expect some visual and user experience oddities as there is no true diagonal support.

### Residences

- Diagonal and narrow 3x1 engineers + 3 custom roof skins
- Diagonal and narrow 3x1 investors + 4 custom roof skins
- Vibrant Cities skins are supported
- Additionally, skins matching jje1000's red tile roof buildings for engineers

### Ornaments

- Diagonal enclosed greenery on plaza and stone pavement
- Skins with diagonal and other corner variations for fences and park paths
