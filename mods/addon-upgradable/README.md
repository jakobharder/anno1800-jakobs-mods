# Upgradable Workers

Terraced versions of worker and artisan residences using Skyscraper mechanics.

Note: Pescatarian workers, artisans do not upgrade.

## Requirements

- Activated DLC `The High Life`
- Mod `[Shared] Ground Textures`
- Either Mod `[Shared] Shared Goods` or DLC `Docklands`

## Buildings

You can either use the skyscraper upgrade button (recommended), or the build menu as a fallback in case of mod conflicts.

Use short-cut "I" to get into skyscraper upgrade mode before unlocking engineer/investor skyscrapers.

There is no cross progression from upgraded residences to their next population tier.
You have to downgrade to normal residences first - just like the skyscrapers handle it. This is due to technical reasons.

### Workers

- Level 1: 30 workers
- Level 2: 40 workers

### Artisans

- Level 1: 50 artisans
- Level 2: 70 artisans

### Farmers

- `[Addon] Pescatarians (Jakob)` workers and artisans provide extra farmer workforce.

### Stone Pavement

- Also function as street.
- Adds Shift+V variations with this ground to various City Decoration and City Lights Pack ornaments.

## Products

All products are available as Dockland imports, or can be produced with `[Shared] Extra Goods (Jakob)`.

- Canned Fish
- Tea
- Suits
- Tools

## Known Issues

- (workers only) The game always prefers one direction when building a single row of houses. You have to rotate such a building everytime you place or upgrade it or its neighbors.
- The arrows for skyscraper upgrade don't show sometimes. The buildings will upgrade if you click anyway.
