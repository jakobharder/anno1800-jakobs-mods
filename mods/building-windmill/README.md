The windmill provides electricity to industry and residents.

It's intended as an alternative to Nate's electricity items for guild houses - a little cheaper, but not as powerful to keep it balanced.

## Content

### Nate's Windmill

*Unlocks at 1 engineer - or creative mode*

Electricity is provided the same way power plants work via roads.

The building has a small guild house radius, meaning you cannot build another guild house or windmill overlapping with its area.

The reduced ranges and exclusive radius are there to ensure the windmill is not just cheaper and more powerful than other power plants or the original item + guild house combination.

Industry influence buff apply.
Palace buffs and guild house buffs don't.

### New World Nate's Windmill

*Unlocks at 1500 obreros or 300 artistas - or creative mode*

Only with DLC `New World Rising` or mod `New World Cities`.

### Grain Mill Bugfix

Grain mills were always facing the opposite direction.
This mod fixes that to have both windmill and grain mill facing the same and correct direction.

## Changes

### 2.0

- Added 3 influence cost
- Reduced construction cost to 10k, 20 steel beams, 10 sails
